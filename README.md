# My Bucket List
This is the final project submisson for the Mobile Applications course project. This is my simple Bucket List app, where users will be able to
open this app and add items to their bucket list of things that they want to do before or after graduation. Each
item will have a name, description, location (latitude and longitude using google maps), and a way to
record whether it has been completed or not.

## Requirements
*Before starting the application, please go to the google play store and update google play services. This will allow you to run google maps in the application, after it is updated.

*Once you start the application, you will receive a pop up to allow application to access the device location. Please allow it to do so, as you will be able to use google maps for the longitude and the latitude. So you will need to have an WIFI connection or you can also use data on your phone.

*For Login Page, use the following details to access the application:

         user name: user@hotmail.com  
         password:  user123456
         
        
  ### Tasks Completed
  
  * App can authenticate users and allow/deny access based on the username/password supplied **(See Requirements for Login Details)**
  * App can launch properly and a screen with a pre-populated, sorted list appears
  * Tapping on the floating action button launches the Add New Item activity
  * The Add New Item activity has all appropriate field, including title, description due data and location.
  * The user is able to drop a pin on google maps and get the longitude and latitude fields populated
  * The new item is put into the list in the correct location after saving
  * Tapping on the check box registers the item as complete and it moves to the bottom of the list
  * Tapping on the name of an item opens the Edit Item activity
  * The Edit Item activity is pre-populated with all appropriate data
  * Changes made in the Edit Item activity are properly reflected back in the list
  * The back arrows in the upper left corner work properly for both Add New Item and Edit Item
